# Instructions

We ask that you only take a maximum of 45 minutes to complete this test. The test is designed in such a way that you won’t be able to finish it in the time. However, feel free to use comments to give notes/pseudo code on how you would go further once the time is up. We use React at ANS.

Prior to beginning:
• Clone this repo
• Checkout a new branch [your name]/tech-test

Task
Using this base app utilise data from the api detailed below:

API Url: https://blockchain.info/ticker

The app should have two views. One for displaying the currencies returned and one for converting an inputted amount of a particular currency. There should be a way of navigating/switching between the two views.

On the list view the currencies should be listed showing:

• Currency Code
• Most recent market price (last)
o With currency symbol pre-pended

On the Conversion view you should have the ability to select a currency, enter an amount and then using the documentation here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/api/exchange_rates_api - figure out how to get a converted value back from the API to display on the screen. This should be displayed in a format that makes it easy to understand that “A amount of B is equal to X amount of Y”.

Styling is up to you, feel free to show any UI/UX/Accessibility knowledge

Committing the code
• Commit as regularly as you normally would
• Commit to your branch when you have reached the 45 minute mark
• Branches will be deleted within 30 days of the interview process
